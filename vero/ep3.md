## **Opening Scene** (5 min)

- **Flashback**:

  - College farewell day â€” Aravind and Ilamathi promise to stay in touch but drift apart after graduation.

- **Present Day**:

  - Aravind hesitates, then sends a secure message to an old encrypted contact... **Ilamathi**.

- **First text response** from her:

  > "Finally woke up?"

---

## **Meeting Ilamathi Again** (10 min)

- Aravind meets Ilamathi in an abandoned internet cafÃ© at night.
- **Ilamathiâ€™s entry**: Confident, sharper now, but carrying emotional scars.
- She reveals:

  - She **used to work at VeroTech**.
  - She quit when she discovered the surveillance codes â€” years ago.
  - She tried warning people â€” no one listened.

**Dialogue sample:**

> **Ilamathi:** (gritting teeth)
> "People don't care when their freedom is stolen slowly... one tap at a time."

- Aravind asks if there's any proof left.
  Ilamathi says,

  > "Maybe. But getting it will make us targets."

## **Kathirâ€™s Introduction** (7 min)

- Ilamathi introduces Aravind to **Kathir**, a quirky ethical hacker who operates from a broken-down gaming cafÃ©.
- Kathir has been quietly monitoring VeroTech servers and OTA patches.
- He's skeptical about helping until Aravind speaks about his family's safety being compromised.

**Kathirâ€™s Dialogue:**

> "You want to fight _VeroTech_?
> That's like trying to hack the sun, bro."

- Kathir reluctantly agrees to help.

---

## **Vetrivelâ€™s Next Move** (7 min)

- **Inside VeroTech**:
  Vetrivel receives intel about **unusual data downloads** from the city (Aravindâ€™s offline laptop).
- He instructs his internal security team to deploy "silent hunters" â€” agents posing as regular citizens.
- **Hint of ruthlessness**:

  > "Burn the weeds before they become forests."

---

## **Plan Setup** (8 min)

- Aravind, Ilamathi, and Kathir make a basic plan:

  - Find the **core server** where the real surveillance master script is hosted.
  - Leak proof to the world before VeroTech shuts them down.

- They must first access a hidden facility called **"Sector 9"**, where the OTA patch servers are physically maintained.

---

## **First Big Problem** (5 min)

- That night, Aravind's house is almost **broken into** by mysterious men.
- He and Meera narrowly escape with Niru.
- They relocate secretly â€” now fully realizing the **danger**.

---

## **Cliffhanger Ending** (3 min)

- **Aravind and Ilamathi** stare at the blueprints of Sector 9 on a screen.

- Kathir smirks and says:

  > "If we fail, they'll erase us like we never existed."

- Aravind looks into the camera (breaking 4th wall subtly) and says:

  > "For my son... for our future... I will not fail."

- **End Credits.**
